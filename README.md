# Experience of an autodidact in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence


Self-education allowed creating the path according to my strengths, background and wishes step by step. With uncertainty after new accomplishments, I realized how much I don't know: like when reaching a peak of a mountain new peak appears from the height. Having no feedback for a long time determined how much I believe in my choice. I felt lonely studying on my own but during the journey, I met enthusiasts from all over the world, and I feel friendship with some of them. Self-education is an opportunity to learn from different perspectives, to live new experiences

---

These steps helped me to organize my self-learning journey:
* I asked myself: 
  * What drives me?, - and from curiosity, inspiration, motivation and obstacles this time the answer was: curiosity, inspiration and motivation
  * What keeps me inspired? - Research, science, high-quality courses, like-minded people, applying AI and Data Science to the real-life problems, business acumen, 'playing' with the data, visualizing, retrieving insights, learning about the world, understanding the concept/idea, successfully applying my mathematical skills
* I respected my time; explained to friends and relatives my purpose; I found my rhythm and kept a balance of study and the rest
* I planned my expenses and wrote them down into my notes to be aware. I applied and received financial aid for the courses and tickets to conferences when I couldn't attend otherwise 
* I researched and made decisions on these topics:
    * Which courses to take?
    * Whom to follow?
    * How to practice?
    * How to highlight my knowledge and skills?
    * What type of work do I like?
    * Where to apply?
    * What do I need to learn about the field to become confident at work?
    * Is there a way for me to become a researcher or a scientist keeping a study-life balance?
