# Experience of an autodidact in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence


Self-education starts with uncertainty. It offers the freedom to build your path that suits your skills, strength, background, and wishes step by step. Having no feedback for a long time can be tough and determines how much you believe in your choices. In some periods, you can feel the more you know the more you don't know. Like climbing on top of a mountain, after reaching the peak you see new peaks from the Haight better. At the start, I felt lonely studying on my own. But during the journey I met enthusiasts from all over the world and found friends amazingly. Nowadays with the varietuy of courses self-education is an opportunity to learn from different perspectives, to live new experiences



To organize my journey of self-education in Data Science & Machine Learning I followed these steps:
* I asked myself: 
  * What drives me?, - and from curiosity, inspiration, motivation and obstacles I have chosen this time: "Curiosity, inspiration and motivation"
  * What keeps me inspired? - "Research, Science, High-quality courses, Like-minded people, Applying AI and Data Science to the real-life problems, Business understanding, 'playing' with the Data, visualizing, retrieving insights, learning about the world, understanding the concept/idea, successfully applying my mathematical skills
* I respected my time; explained to friends and relatives my purpose; I found my rhythm and kept a balance of study and the rest
* I planned my expenses and to be aware I wrote them down into my notes. I applied and received financial aid for the courses and tickets to conferences a few times 
* I researched and made decisions on these topics:
    * Which courses to take?
    * Whom to follow?
    * How to practice?
    * How to highlight my knowledge and skills?
    * What type of work do I like?
    * Where to apply?
    * What do I need to learn about the field to become confident at work?
    * Is there a way for me to become a researcher or scientist keeping a study-life balance?
